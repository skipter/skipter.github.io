                    <h2>New rules for bats</h2>
                </article>
                <p>
                    WAUPACA, Wis. — John Zeamer invested his life savings into a new baseball bat this spring. He paid $250 for a sleek DeMarini Voodoo bat, a model he hopes will help him live up to the nickname Big Country, which he earned for the long balls he hit deep into the outfield.
                    The investment was not entirely his own decision. Zeamer, 10, and millions of other youth baseball players were forced to dig deep into their (or their parents’) pockets for new bats this season, models stamped with the U.S.A. Baseball logo and mandated by new standards issued by the organization.
                    The changeover has angered parents who have been shocked by the bats’ high costs — $45 to $350 — and frustrated that the demand has seemingly outstripped the supply. Many sporting goods stores and online retailers struggled to stock the approved bats, especially the ones at the lower price points.
                    Adding to the anger, a popular model made by Easton was decertified by U.S.A. Baseball in May, leading the company to offer a $500 e-voucher to anyone who had purchased the bat — but only to spend on other Easton products.
                    Leah Zeamer, John’s mother, said she was already in deep for this year’s baseball budget. John wears adult sizes, and everything needed to be replaced: a helmet ($50), two pairs of pants ($70), batting gloves ($20), cleats ($70) and catcher’s gear ($200).
                    “I wasn’t happy because he just got a new bat last year,” Leah Zeamer said. “I really thought he was set for a while.”
